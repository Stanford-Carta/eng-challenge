# Carta Engineering Challenge

Congratulations, and thank you for considering joining Carta!

Please select an engineering challenge to complete. If you have a preference of team to join, please complete the challenge for that team.

Both challenges are designed to give you a somewhat open-ended opportunity to demonstrate your skills, to take less than 3 hours, and to be aligned to practical skills known to be useful in Carta's web development.

## Time

If you've spent longer than the expected time for a challenge and are not finished, feel free to stop! We'd much rather see partial progress and the strengths you can demonstrate through that, than not see anything at all. Done is better than perfect. Your time is valuable and we want to respect that. If you don't finish the basic functionality, please tell us approximately how long you spent and give us a broad outline of what your next steps would have been as part of your submission.

## Submission

Please email your deliverables to Manas (mkhadka@stanford.edu) and Hannah (hhannah@stanford.edu) (Google Drive, ZIP file, private GitHub repository are all okay). Our GitHub usernames are @manaskhadka and @hannahxlee.

The challenges are deliberately open-ended and leave you room for judgment. That said, if you have questions, please reach out to those email addresses!

Good luck, thank you for considering joining Carta, and we hope to hear from you soon!
