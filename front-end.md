# Front End Coding Challenge

Please write a simple React app that mimics Carta's search results page. You can fetch the list of courses from: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jwass91/f8c0b4f887c5db63434b41ad04d56d03/raw/6b532445911a4a871fc8f29bb00b367c7dd2dc61/carta-courses.json`. You should render the list courses, displaying the title, course code(s), description, and unit count. Style it as you see fit. Clicking a course should open up a detail view in which you display info about the instructor ratings.

You are encouraged to also add on one (or more) of the following extensions, however not required.
- A search input that filters the list of courses
- A visual indicator that a course has been viewed (bonus to persist in local storage)
- Render the course offerings on the detail view
- Go crazy with styling
- Any idea of your own 

You are expected to spend 1 - 2.5 hours on this challenge.
If you find yourself spending significantly longer than that, feel free to stop and submit partial progress. Your time is valuable, and we'd much rather see your strengths demonstrated through some progress than see nothing at all.

Functional components using React hooks written in TypeScript are preferred, but not a requirement. 

You shouldn't need to consume any packages but you may if it aids your custom extension.
