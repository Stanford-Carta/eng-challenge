# Front End Coding Challenge

Please write a simple React app that mimics Carta's search results page. You can fetch the list of courses from: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jwass91/f8c0b4f887c5db63434b41ad04d56d03/raw/6b532445911a4a871fc8f29bb00b367c7dd2dc61/carta-courses.json`. You should render the list courses, displaying the title, course code(s), description, and unit count. Style it as you see fit. Clicking a course should open up a detail view in which you info about the instructor ratings.

You are encouraged to also add on one (or more) of the following extensions, however not required.
- A search input that filters the list of courses
- A visual indicator that a course has been viewed (bonus to persist in local storage)
- Render the course offerings on the detail view
- Go crazy with styling
- Any idea of your own 

You are expected to spend 1-2 hours on this challenge.

Functional components using React hooks written in TypeScript are preferred, but not a requirement. 

You shouldn't need to consume any packages but you may if it aids your custom extension.
